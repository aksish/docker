Basically, you have three options:

Neither specify EXPOSE nor -p.
Only specify EXPOSE.
Specify EXPOSE and -p.
If you do not specify any of those, the service in the container will not be accessible from anywhere except from inside the container itself.

If you EXPOSE a port, the service in the container is not accessible from outside Docker, but from inside other Docker containers. So this is good for inter-container communication.

If you EXPOSE and -p a port, the service in the container is accessible from anywhere, even outside Docker.

#add host
